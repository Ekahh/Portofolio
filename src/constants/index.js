Currently, I am participating in the Studi Independen program at Infinite Learning, focusing on Web Development and UI/UX Design.

I have a strong interest in building websites that can be enjoyed and used by a broad audience. One project that I am particularly excited about is creating a personal website to store and organize recipes I have made and plan to make. This project will allow me to apply the skills I am developing, combining both my passion for web development and my love for cooking. I aim to create a user-friendly, visually appealing platform that makes it easy for others to save and share their favorite recipes.
